This repository demonstrates a common Java error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  This exception occurs when trying to access an array element using an index that is either negative or greater than or equal to the array's size. The root cause is often an off-by-one error in loop conditions or array indexing calculations.
